找出每个玩家第一次登录的日期。

按玩家分组，求每个玩家登录日期的最小值。

```mysql
select player_id,min(event_date) as `first_login`
from Activity
group by player_id
```

### 512 Game Play Analysis II 游戏玩家分析II

找出最早登录时间和登陆时的设备

#### 解法一

对每个玩家，判断其是不是玩家登录的最早时间。登录的最早时间通过子查询判断。

```
select A.player_id,A.device_id
from Activity as A
where A.event_date = (
    select event_date
    from Activity
    where player_id = A.player_id
    order by event_date
    limit 0,1
)
```

#### 解法二

对玩家分组，找出每个玩家的最早登录日期。

```mysql
(
    select player_id,min(event_date) as `mdate`
    from Activity
    group by player_id
) as B
```

再连接Activity表，筛选出每个玩家，最早登录日期时的设备。

```mysql
select A.player_id,A.device_id
from 
Activity as A
join
(
    select player_id,min(event_date) as `mdate`
    from Activity
    group by player_id
) as B
    on(A.player_id = B.player_id and A.event_date = B.mdate)
```

不用连接，用in也行的。

```mysql
select A.player_id,A.device_id
from 
Activity as A
where (A.player_id,A.event_date) in
(
    select player_id,min(event_date) as `mdate`
    from Activity
    group by player_id
)
```

### 534 游戏玩家分析III Game Play Analysis III

分析每个玩家在日期A之前玩游戏的个数。

#### 解法一

先按player_id和event_date升序，再统计每个人的玩游戏的前缀和。

对于前缀和，**用户变量**解决更合适。

用户变量：pre_id——上一行的player_id，pre_date—— 上一行的event_date，sum_cnt——每个人games_played前缀和。

```mysql
(SELECT @pre_id:=NULL,@pre_date:=NULL,@sum_cnt:=0) AS B
```

前缀和计算逻辑:

```mysql
if (当前行的player_id = pre_id and 当前行的event_date != pre_date){
    sum_cnt = sum_cnt + 当前行的games_played
}else{
    sum_cnt = games_played
}
```

连接表Activity和表B：

```mysql
SELECT 
	A.player_id,
	A.event_date,
@sum_cnt:= IF(A.player_id = @pre_id AND A.event_date != @pre_date,
			@sum_cnt + A.games_played,
			A.games_played 
		) AS `games_played_so_far`,
@pre_id:=A.player_id AS `player_ids`,
@pre_date:=A.event_date AS `event_dates`
FROM 
activity AS A,(
SELECT @pre_id:= NULL,@pre_date:= NULL,@sum_cnt:=0) AS B
ORDER BY A.player_id,A.event_date
```

但由于**用户变量**的限制，多出了两个字段player_ids，event_dates。

再投一次影，去掉多出的字段。

```mysql
SELECT C.player_id,C.event_date,C.games_played_so_far
FROM (
SELECT 
	A.player_id,
	A.event_date,
@sum_cnt:=
		if(A.player_id = @pre_id AND A.event_date != @pre_date,
			@sum_cnt + A.games_played,
			A.games_played 
		)
		AS `games_played_so_far`,
@pre_id:=A.player_id AS `player_ids`,
@pre_date:=A.event_date AS `event_dates`

FROM 
activity AS A,(SELECT @pre_id:=NULL,@pre_date:=NULL,@sum_cnt:=0) AS B
order BY A.player_id,A.event_date
) AS C
```

#### 解法二

将每个人，在日期A当天和之前，玩过的游戏个数累加。

同一个，在日期A当天和之前，用表自连接，group by，找出这些行。也是这类**累加和**或**前缀和**问题的通用解法。

```mysql
SELECT *
FROM Activity AS A JOIN Activity AS B ON (A.player_id = B.player_id AND A.event_date <= B.event_date)
```

补上group by及组内求和。

```mysql
SELECT B.player_id,B.event_date,SUM(A.games_played) AS `games_played_so_far`
FROM Activity AS A JOIN Activity AS B 
ON (A.player_id = B.player_id AND A.event_date <= B.event_date)
GROUP BY B.player_id,B.event_date
```

###  550 游戏玩家分析IV Game Play Analysis IV

首次登录后，紧接着第二天又登录的人数占总人数的比例。

#### 解法一

第一步要明确每个人首次登录的时间。用group by完成。

```mysql
(
SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS `date`
FROM Activity
GROUP BY player_id
) AS C
```

表activity与表C连接，排除掉日期不是首次登录日的行。

```mysql
SELECT *
FROM Activity AS A
JOIN (
SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS `date`
FROM Activity
GROUP BY player_id
) AS C ON (A.player_id = C.player_id AND A.event_date = C.DATE)
```

接着再left join表activity ，排除掉首次登录后第二天没有登录的行。这里用left join，并投影处字段A.player_id和B.player_id。部分B.player_id 为NULL， 表示首次登录后第二天没有登录。

```mysql
SELECT DISTINCT A.player_id AS id1,B.player_id AS id2
FROM Activity AS A
JOIN (
SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS `date`
FROM Activity
GROUP BY player_id
) AS C ON (A.player_id = C.player_id AND A.event_date = C.DATE)
LEFT JOIN Activity AS B ON (A.player_id = B.player_id AND DATEDIFF(B.event_date,A.event_date)=1)
```

基于这样的结果，计算比例：

```mysql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(IF(id2 IS NOT NULL,1,0)) / COUNT(DISTINCT id1),2) AS `fraction`
FROM (
SELECT DISTINCT A.player_id AS id1,B.player_id AS id2
FROM Activity AS A
JOIN (
SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS `date`
FROM Activity
GROUP BY player_id
) AS C ON (A.player_id = C.player_id AND A.event_date = C.DATE)
LEFT JOIN Activity AS B ON (A.player_id = B.player_id AND DATEDIFF(B.event_date,A.event_date)=1)
) AS D
```

#### 解法二

先求出首次登录后第二天又登录的人数。

首次登录日期：

```mysql
			SELECT MIN(event_date)
			FROM Activity
			WHERE player_id = xxxx
```

表activity自连接，排除掉日期不是首次登录日的行。并统计人数。

```mysql
		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT A.player_id)
		FROM Activity AS A
		JOIN Activity AS B ON A.player_id = B.player_id AND DATEDIFF(B.event_date,A.event_date)=1
		WHERE A.event_date = (
			SELECT MIN(event_date)
			FROM Activity
			WHERE player_id = A.player_id
		)
```

总人数更明显：

```mysql
		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id)
		FROM Activity
```

两者相除：

```mysql
SELECT ROUND(
	(
		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT A.player_id)
		FROM Activity AS A
		JOIN Activity AS B ON A.player_id = B.player_id AND DATEDIFF(B.event_date,A.event_date)=1
		WHERE A.event_date = (
			SELECT MIN(event_date)
			FROM Activity
			WHERE player_id = A.player_id
		)
	)
	/
	(
		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id)
		FROM Activity
	)
	,
	2
) AS `fraction`
```
