### 612-613 平面和直线上的距离

### 612 平面上的最近距离 Shortest Distance in a Plane

应用平面上的点集公式。

```mysql
SELECT ROUND(min(SQRT((P1.X-P2.X)*(P1.X-P2.X) + (P1.Y-P2.Y)*(P1.Y-P2.Y))),2) AS `shortest`
FROM point_2d AS P1 
JOIN point_2d AS P2 
ON (P1.X < P2.X OR P1.X = P2.X AND P1.Y < P2.y)
```

或

```mysql
SELECT ROUND(min(SQRT(POW((P1.X-P2.X),2) + POW((P1.Y-P2.Y),2))),2) AS `shortest`
FROM point_2d AS P1 
JOIN point_2d AS P2 
ON (P1.X < P2.X OR P1.X = P2.X AND P1.Y < P2.y)
```

### 613 直线上的最近距离 Shortest Distance in a Line

表Point

```
| x   |
|-----|
| -1  |
| 0   |
| 2   |
```

表自连接，构造偏序关系。

```mysql
select min(P2.x-P1.x) as `shortest`
from Point as P1 join Point as P2
on(P1.x < P2.x)
```

或者不用偏序

```mysql
select min(abs(P2.x-P1.x)) as `shortest`
from Point as P1 join Point as P2
on(P1.x != P2.x)
```
